Hereâ€™s a concise summary of your Jupyter Notebook content for your GitHub repository:

---

 Summary of Work Done:

1. Imported Required Libraries:
   - Utilized `pandas` for data manipulation.
   - Included warnings handling for better script management.

2. Explored Dataset:
   - Used `df.info()` to inspect the structure and types of data.
   - Checked for missing values using `df.isna().sum()`.

3. Data Cleaning:
   - Filled missing values in the `Gender` column with 'f'.
   - Dropped the `Quantity` column as it was deemed unnecessary.
   - Investigated and filled missing values in the `USDPrice` column based on related attributes like `Gem` and `Metal`.

4. Filtered Data:
   - Removed records with missing values in critical columns (`USDPrice` and `UserID`).
   - Replaced missing values in `CategoryCode` and `BrandID` with defaults.

5. Data Transformation:
   - Processed categorical features like `Gem`, `Metal`, and `Color`.
   - Modified `Datetime` column to retain only the date portion.

6. Generated Analytical Views:
   - Created a pivot table summarizing sales data indexed by `Datetime`.
