Jewelry Database Processing Project
This project involves working with a jewelry database to perform data extraction, transformation, and code migration tasks. The steps carried out are as follows:

1. Code Conversion
The initial code provided was written in R.
Successfully converted the R code to Python, ensuring equivalent functionality and output.
2. Dataset Extraction
Extracted the processed dataset and saved it in CSV format for further analysis.
3. Data Transformation
Several transformations were performed on the dataset to make it more structured and usable:

Date Column Split:

The date column was split into two new columns:
date: Containing the date part.
time: Containing the time part.
Column Alias Split:

The column_alias column was further split into meaningful sub-components for improved clarity and analysis.
Tools and Technologies Used
Languages: Python (Conversion from R)
Libraries:
pandas (for data manipulation)
csv (for file handling)
File Format: CSV
